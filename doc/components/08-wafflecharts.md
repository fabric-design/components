*Development in progress*

Waffle chart visualize data in a way that user can see both overall amount and status for each element.

Do not use it when:
- - elements are not stand-alone (ex. time, money values),
- - there is no need to show status of each element.


## Box stages
Although we have six box stages, try not to use more than three stages at the time.

## Brick sizes
Boxes are available in two sizes. Decision depends on available space and potential amount of data

## Shape
Brick visualization is built from top to bottom and from left to right.

Number of boxes in a row should be 5, 10 or n*10 (20, 30, 40 etc.).
