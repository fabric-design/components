# Spider Charts
*Development in progress*

Spider chart is used to emphasize on values differences for one element or to compare value trend for different elements.

Do not use it when:
- - different values can be put on timeline (use Line Chart instead)
- - you want to emphatize only on local difference between elements (use Bar Chart instead)


## One element
When Spider Chart shows only values for one element, graph shape is filled with color:

## Interactions
When userâ€™s activity indicates interest in graph details (ex. mouse over graph), value dots are shown. When mouse cursor is over the value dot - tooltip with exact value appears:
